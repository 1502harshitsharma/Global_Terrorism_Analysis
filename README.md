The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (Start), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

Through statistical analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis, the project will also explore the underlying factors that contribute to the emergence and persistence of terrorist groups, including social, economic, and political factors, as well as ideological and religious beliefs. The project will also examine the effectiveness of counterterrorism policies and strategies, identifying best practices and areas for improvement.

The project will produce a series of reports and data visualizations that will be made available to policymakers, researchers, and the general public. These reports will provide insights into global terrorism trends and patterns, helping to inform policy decisions and public debate. Ultimately, the project aims to contribute to a better understanding of the complex and multifaceted phenomenon of terrorism, and to support efforts to prevent and combat terrorism around the world.

There were 181691 rows and 135 columns that were consisting of Event,Group, Region, COuntry, City, Killed,etc.
